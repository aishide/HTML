<h2> Block-level Elements </h2>
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
<br>
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
<br>
Example :  Two commonly used block elements are: "p" and "div"
<br>
<p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>
<br>
<hr>

<h2> Inline Elements </h2>
<br>
An inline element does not start on a new line.
<br>
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
<br>
<p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<div style="background-color:#f5da42; padding:20px;">
<p> This is created by using div tag </p>
</div>

<p> The div and p makes its own space </p>
<br>

Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet.

<h3> Div as container </h3>
<br>

<style>
div {
background-color: yellow;

width: 300px;
margin: auto;
}
</style>

<!-- For center align 
width: 300px;
margin: auto;-->


<div>
<h3> This is a container</h3>
<p> using div tag </p> 
</div>

<div style="background-color:pink;">
<p> div with change in color </p>
</div>

<pre>
Float
The CSS float property was not originally meant to align <div> elements side-by-side, but has been used for this purpose for many years.

The CSS float property is used for positioning and formatting content and allows elements to be positioned horizontally, rather than vertically.
</pre>

<br>
<pre>
Flex
The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give it the status as a flex container.
</pre>

<pre>
"style"
.mycontainer {
  display: flex;
}
.mycontainer > div {
  width:33%;
}
"/style"
"/head"
</pre>
<br>

<pre>
Grid
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more than one row and position each row individually.

The CSS grid method requires that you surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give the status as a grid container, and you must specify the width of each column.
</pre>
<br>

<pre>
"style"
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 33% 33% 33%;
}
"/style"
</pre>

<p> JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName() method </p>

<pre>
The id Attribute
The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

In the following example we have an <h1> element that points to the id name "myHeader". This <h1> element will be styled according to the #myHeader style definition in the head section:
</pre>

<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>
<br>

<p> An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page. </p>
<br>

<p> Example: </p>
<iframe src="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/40673202879514470/" height="200" width="300" title="description"></iframe>
<br>
<p> The "noscript" tag in HTML is used to display content for users whose browsers do not support JavaScript or have it disabled. </p>
<br>
<p> The "meta" tag gives extra information about your webpage to the browser and search engines. It goes inside the "head" section of your HTML. </p>
<br>
<br><hr>

<pre>
<h2>Setting The Viewport</h2>
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

You should include the following "meta" element in all your web pages

"meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""

This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta
</pre>
<br>
The "script" element is used to define client-side JavaScripts.
<br>
<p> The "base" tag sets a base URL for all relative links (href, src) on a webpage. It goes inside the <head> tag and helps avoid repeating the full URL everywhere.</p>

<br>

<pre>
"header" - Defines a header for a document or a section
"nav" - Defines a set of navigation links
"section" - Defines a section in a document
"article" - Defines independent, self-contained content
"aside" - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
"footer" - Defines a footer for a document or a section
"details" - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
"summary"  - Defines a heading for the <details> element

Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!
<br>
A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.
<br>
Bootstrap is a free, open-source front-end framework used to build responsive and mobile-friendly websites easily using pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components.<br>

<h2>What are Semantic Elements?</h2>
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Examples of semantic elements: "img", "table", and "article" - Clearly defines its content.
</pre><br>
<p> The "section" element defines a section in a document. </p>
<br>
<p>
The "article" element specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.</p>
<br>
<p> we can nest article in section and vice-versaa </p>
<br>
<pre> The "header" element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

A header element typically contains:

one or more heading elements ("h1" - "h6")
logo or icon
authorship information </pre>
<br>
<pre>
The "footer" element defines a footer for a document or section.

A footer element typically contains:

authorship information
copyright information
contact information
sitemap
back to top links
related documents
</pre>
<br>
<pre>
The "nav
" element defines a set of navigation links.
</pre>
<nav>
  <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
  <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
  <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
  <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
</nav>
<br>
<pre>
The "aside" element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).

The "aside>" content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.

( like paheli and bojho in ncert )
</pre>
<br>
<pre>
The "figure" tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

The "figcaption" tag defines a caption for a "figure" element. The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a "figure" element.

The "img" element defines the actual image/illustration. 
</pre>
<br>

<figure>
  <img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
  <figcaption>Fig1. - Trulli, Puglia, Italy.</figcaption>
</figure>
